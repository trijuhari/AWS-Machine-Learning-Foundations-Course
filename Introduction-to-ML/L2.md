## Why AWS?
The AWS achine learning mission is to put machine learning in the hands of every developer.

* AWS offers the broadest and deepest set of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services with unmatched flexibility.
* You can accelerate your adoption of machine learning with AWS SageMaker. Models that previously took months to build and required specialized expertise can now be built in weeks or even days.
* AWS offers the most comprehensive cloud offering optimized for machine learning.
More machine learning happens at AWS than anywhere else.

### Getting started
In addition to educational resources such as AWS Training and Certification, AWS has created a portfolio of educational devices to help put new machine learning techniques into the hands of developers in unique and fun ways, with AWS DeepLens, AWS DeepRacer, and AWS DeepComposer.

* **AWS DeepLens**: A deep learningâ€“enabled video camera
* **AWS DeepRacer**: An autonomous race car designed to test reinforcement learning models by racing on a physical track
* **AWS DeepComposer**: A composing device powered by generative AI that creates a melody that transforms into a completely original song
* AWS ML Trai**ning and Certification**: Curriculum used to train Amazon developers

### Computer Vision and Its Applications
[Introduction](https://youtu.be/LKV97Js0QFI): tv:


### In the video, you have learned:

* How computer vision got started
  * Early applications of computer vision needed hand-annotated images to successfully train a model.
  * These early applications had limited applications because of the human labor required to annotate images.
* Three main components of neural network
  
  * Input Layer: This layer receives data during training and when inference is performed after the model has been trained.
  * Hidden Layer: This layer finds important features in the input data that have predictive power based on the labels provided during training.
  * Output Layer: This layer generates the output or prediction of your model.
 
* Modern computer vision
  * Modern-day applications of computer vision use neural networks call convolutional neural networks or CNNs.
  * In these neural networks, the hidden layers are used to extract different information about images. We call this process feature extraction.
* 
  * These models can be trained much faster on millions of images and generate a better prediction than earlier models.
### How this growth occured
Since 2010, we have seen a rapid decrease in the computational costs required to train the complex neural networks used in computer vision.
Larger and larger pre-labeled datasets have become generally available. This has decreased the time required to collect the data needed to train many models.

### Summary
Computer vision (CV) has many real-world applications. In this video, we cover examples of image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and activity recognition. Here's a brief summary of what you learn about each topic in the video:

* **Image classification** is the most common application of computer vision in use today. Image classification can be used to answer questions like What's in this image? This type of task has applications in text detection or optical character recognition (OCR) and content moderation.
* **Object detection** is closely related to image classification, but it allows users to gather more granular detail about an image. For example, rather than just knowing whether an object is present in an image, a user might want to know if there are multiple instances of the same object present in an image, or if objects from different classes appear in the same image.
* **Semantic segmentation** is another common application of computer vision that takes a pixel-by-pixel approach. Instead of just identifying whether an object is present or not, it tries to identify down the pixel level which part of the image is part of the object.

* **Activity recognition** is an application of computer vision that is based around videos rather than just images. Video has the added dimension of time and, therefore, models are able to detect changes that occur over time.
  
### **New Terms**
* **Input Layer**: The first layer in a neural network. This layer receives all data that passes through the neural network.
* **Hidden Layer**: A layer that occurs between the output and input layers. Hidden layers are tailored to a specific task.
* **Output Layer**: The last layer in a neural network. This layer is where the predictions are generated based on the information captured in the hidden layers.
