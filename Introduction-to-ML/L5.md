# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
## Introduction

[Introduction](https://youtu.be/5DfFaAl1Wmc):tv:

Lesson outline 
* object oriented  programming syntax 
  * procedural  vs object oriented programming
  * classes, object, method, and  atributes
  * coding class
  * magic methods 
  * inheritance 
* Using object oriented programming to make  a python packages
  *  making a package 
  *  tour of **scikit-learn**  source code
  *  putting your package on pypi

## Why Object Oriented Programming ?
 becuse there is so many benefit  over procedural programming , which is the  programming style  you must like ly first  learned. As you will seen  in this lesson:
 * oop allows you to create large , modular,  program that can easily  expand over time
 * oop  hide the implementation  from the end user '

Consider Python packages like **Scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **NumPy**. These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming. **Scikit-learn**, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming. This package has expanded over the years with new functionality and new algorithms.

When you train a machine learning algorithm with **Scikit-learn**, you don't have to know anything about how the algorithms work or how they were coded. You can focus directly on the modeling.

Here's an example taken from the Scikit-learn website:

``` python
from sklearn import svm 
X = [0,1][1,1]
y = [0,1]
clf = svm.SVC()
clf.fit(X,y)
```

How does Scikit-learn train the SVM model? You don't need to know because the implementation is hidden with object-oriented programming. If the implementation changes, you (as a user of Scikit-learn) might not ever find out. Whether or not you should understand how SVM works is a different question.

In this lesson, you'll practice the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. By the end of the lesson, you'll have built a Python package using object-oriented programming.
## Procedural vs. object-oriented programming

### Objects are defined by characteristics and actions

### Characteristics and actions in English grammar
you can also think that  characteristic  and action  is in terms of english grammar. A characteristic corresponds  to a noun  and an action  corresponds to a verb.

Let's pick something from the real world: a dog. Some characteristics of the dog include the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. Some actions a dog can take include to bark, to run, to bite, and to eat. These are all verbs.

## Class, object, method, and attribute

[Video](https://youtu.be/yvVMJt09HuA):tv:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) vocabulary
* Class: A blueprint consisting of methods and attributes.
* Object: An instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, or a blue shirt. However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.
* Attribute: A descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.
* Method: An action that a class or object could take.
* OOP: A commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming.
* Encapsulation: One of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details, much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

## Quiz

## OOP syntax
### Object-oriented programming syntax
In this video, you'll see what a class and object look like in Python. In the next section, you'll have the chance to play around with the code. Finally, you'll write your own class.

### [Video](https://youtu.be/Y8ZVw1LHI8E) :tv:
### Function versus method
In the video above, at 1:44, the dialogue mistakenly calls init a function rather than a method. Why is init not a function?

A function and a method look very similar. They both use the **def** keyword. They also have inputs and return outputs. **The difference is that a method is inside of a class whereas a function is outside of a class**.

### What is self?
If you instantiate two objects, how does Python differentiate between these two objects?

``` python
#object
hirt_one = Shirt('red', 'S', 'short-sleeve', 15)
shirt_two = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 20)
```


That's where self comes into play. If you call the change_price method on shirt_one, how does Python know to change the price of shirt_one and not of shirt_two?

``` python
shirt_one.change_price(10)
```

**Self** tells Python where to look in the computer's memory for the shirt_one object. Then, Python changes the price of the shirt_one object. When you call the change_price method, shirt_one.change_price(12), **self** is implicitly passed in.

The word **self** is just a convention. You could actually use any other name as long as you are consisten, but you should use **self** to avoid confusing people.



## Exercise: OOP syntax practice, part 1

You need to download three files for this exercise. These files are located on this page in the Supporting materials section.

* Shirt_exercise.ipynb contains explanations and instructions.
* Answer.py containing solution to the exercise.
* Tests.py tests for checking your code: You can run these tests using the last code cell at the bottom of the notebook.


Open the Shirt Exercise.ipynb notebook file using Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.

## Exercise: OOP syntax practice, part 2
Now that you've had some practice instantiating objects, it's time to write your own class from scratch.
